# Security Checklist for AI/ML Applications

This checklist is designed to help developers ensure that AI/ML applications and models are developed securely, addressing common vulnerabilities and best practices throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.

---

## 1. **Insecure Model Serialization (Pickle Vulnerabilities)**
- [ ] Avoid using `pickle` for model serialization.
- [ ] Use secure serialization formats like **ONNX** or **TensorFlowâ€™s SavedModel**.
- [ ] For storing vectors/tensors, avoid `allow_pickle=True` in functions like `numpy.save()` or `torch.save()`.

---

## 2. **Building a Model and Securing It**
- [ ] Validate models before deserialization.
- [ ] Ensure TensorFlow models with **custom operators** are thoroughly reviewed.
- [ ] Securely handle TensorFlow operations (e.g., `io.write_file`, `io.read_file`) to prevent exploitation.

---

## 3. **Malicious Lambda Layers in Keras**
- [ ] Inspect and validate Lambda layers in Keras models.
- [ ] Limit the use of Lambda layers and prefer predefined, trusted operations.

---

## 4. **Preventing Model Inference Exploits**
- [ ] Implement **API authentication** (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
- [ ] Use **rate limiting** for model inference APIs.
- [ ] Apply **model obfuscation** and **differential privacy** to protect training data during inference.

---

## 5. **Preventing Adversarial Attacks**
- [ ] Use **adversarial training** to improve model robustness.
- [ ] Implement **input validation** and **sanitization** techniques to filter adversarial examples.
- [ ] Continuously monitor for unusual patterns in input data that could indicate adversarial attempts.

---

## 6. **Hardcoded Secrets**
- [ ] Avoid hardcoding secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords) in the codebase.
- [ ] Use **environment variables** or **secure vaults** to manage secrets.
- [ ] Regularly **rotate** and **audit** credentials.

---

## 7. **Broken Authentication and Authorization**
- [ ] Enforce **strong authentication** mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
- [ ] Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit access to models and data.
- [ ] Use **multi-factor authentication** (MFA) where possible.

---

## 8. **Lack of Input Validation**
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- [ ] Use **adversarial training** to harden the model against malicious inputs.
- [ ] Implement strict input filtering techniques to prevent malicious data injection.

---

## 9. **Insecure Preprocessing Pipelines**
- [ ] Ensure **secure file handling** and input checks during preprocessing.
- [ ] Implement proper **error handling** to prevent data leakage or system compromise.
- [ ] Secure preprocessing code to avoid exposing sensitive information during data transformation.

---

## 10. **Exposing Sensitive Model Details (Model Inference Attacks)**
- [ ] Limit the exposure of model details during inference (e.g., prediction confidence scores).
- [ ] Use **model obfuscation** techniques to hide internal model details.
- [ ] Implement **differential privacy** to prevent sensitive data inference from model predictions.

---

## 11. **Insecure Deployment Configurations**
- [ ] Secure deployment environments with **firewalls** and **encryption**.
- [ ] Follow **cloud security best practices** (e.g., secure access control, encryption at rest).
- [ ] Use **container security** to isolate and protect models during deployment.

---

## 12. **Lack of Explainability and Interpretability**
- [ ] Implement **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to ensure model decisions can be interpreted.
- [ ] Avoid relying on **black-box** models without clear justification for their decisions.
- [ ] Ensure models are based on **legitimate features** and not biased data.

---

## 13. **Overly Broad Permissions**
- [ ] Apply the **principle of least privilege (PoLP)** to model and system access.
- [ ] Regularly audit and restrict model permissions to minimize exposure.
- [ ] Ensure models have access only to necessary resources and data.

---

## 14. **Failure to Monitor and Update Models**
- [ ] Continuously monitor model performance for signs of degradation or potential security threats.
- [ ] Regularly **retrain models** to maintain accuracy and security against evolving attack techniques.
- [ ] Apply **security patches** to address known vulnerabilities in the model or framework.

---

## 15. **Insecure Handling of AI/ML Logs**
- [ ] Securely store logs to prevent unauthorized access.
- [ ] **Obfuscate sensitive data** in logs to prevent leakage of confidential information.
- [ ] Restrict log access to **authorized personnel** only, and ensure proper audit trails are maintained.

---

By following this checklist, developers can ensure that AI/ML applications and models are secure from common vulnerabilities and threats, fostering a safer development and deployment process.
