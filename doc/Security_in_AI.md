### Examples of Attacks on AI/ML Systems

Understanding past incidents helps us build more secure systems. Some notable attack types include:

1. **Adversarial Attacks**: Small, crafted changes to input data that cause AI models to make incorrect predictions.
2. **Model Poisoning**: Manipulating training data to inject biases or vulnerabilities.
3. **Data Privacy Breaches**: Exposing sensitive data used for training or inference.
